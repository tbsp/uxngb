; WARNING: Be careful if calling this with IME reset (`di`), if this was compiled
; with the `-h` flag, then a hardware bug is very likely to cause this routine to
; go horribly wrong.
; Note: the VBlank handler recognizes being called from this function (through `hVBlankFlag`),
; and does not try to save registers if so. To be safe, consider all registers to be destroyed.
; @destroy Possibly every register. The VBlank handler stops preserving anything when executed from this function
